# Feature requests

-  Prioritizing types (direct mention, team mention, other)
-  Desktop notifications + granular controls for them
-  Opt-in algorithmic sorting of the notifications list, based off of repos I engage with most often

- Notifications as a todo list. (We have enough todo list apps, but this one would be awesome)

- triage notifications from an Inbox to some prioritized list/lists/buckets
-  filter/mute bots like greenkeeper and renovatebot. I’m drowning in emails from repos that come from humans
- on projects I maintain/contribute: I'm waiting for answer(s) (maybe a "reminder" selectbox as I reply/subscribe)
- Grouped by project with a “this project has new things” linking to a catch up page for that repo
- Offline sync, prioritising by thumbs up / time opened / filtering issues from PR’s
